This is a very basic blogging website made by Anique (@aniquekhan004@gmail.com).
However , the authentication system this website uses is very professional and secure.

1. Here , you can signup and login to your account. There's also a reset password option , if someone forgets their password.
2. You can create your blogs with a title and content and that will be stored in the db.
3. You can update and delete your blogs.
4. On the home page , you can see everyone's blog posts arranged by the latest dates.
5. Moreover , you can change your username and email and even your profile picture as per your likings.

There is much more to the app. You can check out the heroku link which hosts this website.
